## Diabetes Disease Prediction using SVM Classifier

# Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a patient has diabetes or not using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The system is built using machine learning techniques to provide accurate and efficient predictions based on medical data.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset, which contains medical records of female patients aged 21 and above. The dataset includes features such as:

Pregnancies

Glucose Level

Blood Pressure

Skin Thickness

Insulin Level

BMI (Body Mass Index)

Diabetes Pedigree Function

Age

# Technology Stack

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

# Project Workflow

1.Data Collection

Import the dataset into the project.

2.Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values.

Standardizing the dataset using StandardScaler.

3.Splitting the Data

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.

4.Model Selection

Using SVM Classifier with RBF or Linear Kernel.

5.Model Training

Training the model on the training dataset.

6.Model Evaluation

Evaluating the model using Accuracy Score.

Printing the accuracy percentage.

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/diabetes-prediction-svm.git

Install the required libraries:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn jupyter

Run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

# Results

The model provides a high accuracy in predicting diabetes cases based on the input features. The accuracy score is displayed at the end of the notebook.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates how SVM Classifier can be effectively used in predicting diabetes disease based on medical data. The model's accuracy showcases its potential in assisting medical professionals in early diagnosis.

# Future Enhancements

Adding more features to improve model performance.

Hyperparameter tuning.

Deploying the model as a web application.
